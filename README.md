## Common Interview Topics by Company

### Big Tech (FAANG+)
- Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- System Design

### Quant Firms & Trading Companies
- Advanced Data Structures
- Math and Probability
- Optimization Algorithms

### Startups
- Practical problem solving
- JavaScript-specific optimizations
- Real-world applications

## Recommended Study Approach

1. **Learn the concept** - Understand the theory behind each data structure/algorithm
2. **Implement from scratch** - Code it yourself without looking at solutions
3. **Solve related problems** - Practice with LeetCode/HackerRank problems
4. **Review and optimize** - Refactor your solutions for better time/space complexity
5. **Mock interviews** - Practice explaining your approach verbally

## Recommended Resources

### Books
- "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
- "JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms" by Sammie Bae
- "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS (more academic)

### Online Platforms
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- AlgoExpert
- Pramp (for mock interviews)

### Courses
- MIT OpenCourseWare: Introduction to Algorithms
- Stanford Algorithms Specialization (Coursera)
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass (Udemy)

## Weekly Study Plan Template

- **Days 1-2**: Learn new concept and implement the data structure/algorithm
- **Days 3-5**: Solve 5-10 related problems of increasing difficulty
- **Day 6**: Review and optimize solutions
- **Day 7**: Mock interview or explain concepts to someone else

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for static typing benefits
- Include thorough documentation
- Add unit tests for each implementation
- Analyze time and space complexity
